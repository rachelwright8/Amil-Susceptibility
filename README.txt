A. millepora Disease Susceptibility Project

Eight genotypes (n = 18 fragments per genotype) were treated with either Vibrio diazotrophicus (n = 6 per genotype) or V. owensii (n = 6 per genotype). The remaining six fragments per genotype did not receive a bacterial challenge.

sample key:
N = no abrasion
A = abrasion
C = control (no bacterial treatment)
D = Vibrio diazotrophicus
O = Vibrio owensii
L = Baseline (pre-treatment) sample from Lizard
W = Baseline (pre-treatment) sample from Wilkie
First number: 4, 5, 7, 9 = genotypes from Lizard, 22, 26, 27, 30 = genotypes from Wilkie
Last number: 1, 2, 3 = biological replicate
